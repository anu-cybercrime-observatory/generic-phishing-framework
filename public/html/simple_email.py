Hi all,
ACYA @ ANU is attempting to put together a central registry to pair Mandarin students with potential tutors. We hope that it will streamline the process of finding a tutor and also the process of finding students for potential tutors to teach.
If you would like to be on the registry as a potential tutor, please respond to this email with your name, degree program at ANU, level of spoken and written proficiency in Mandarin, Cantonese, or any other language, and your phone number.
Thanks,
the ACYA @ ANU Team.
